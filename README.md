I am an experienced marketer transitioning to cybersecurity with a profound interest in Social Engineering Penetration Testing and CTI. 

## Objective

Through my work in cybersecurity marketing, Iâ€™ve developed a deep understanding of the field and a desire to move beyond marketing creation into hands-on cybersecurity roles. Having collaborated closely with security teams, Iâ€™m eager to leverage my knowledge and skills to contribute directly in CTI or penetration testing, bridging technical expertise with real-world cyber defense.
