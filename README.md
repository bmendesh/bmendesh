I am an experienced marketer transitioning to cybersecurity with a profound interest in Social Engineering Penetration Testing and CTI. 

## Objective

My journey in cybersecurity marketing has led me to develop a deep interest for cybersecurity itself, and I am now eager to transition into this field.
As a marketing professional in the cybersecurity space, I've worked closely with cybersecurity teams to create impactful and technically accurate content that helps bridge the gap between technical expertise and strategic messaging.
